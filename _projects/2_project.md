## About the project
This is a working paper. The dataset collects tweets about Russo-Ukrainian War of global news channels, detecting their stances to Russia/Ukraine automatically by machine learning. By adding other information like emotion or moral foundations of those tweets, or by combining with national variables like geographical closeness and cultural closeeness, the working paper wants to know what drives the stance towards this war.
