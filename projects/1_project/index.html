Existing research links moral narratives to hate speech but does not reveal the role it plays in the formation and dissemination of hate speech. Based on Moral Foundations Theory, this study analyzed nearly 10 million tweets in the Russo-Ukrainian war, by using fixed effects model, Granger causality test, and causal discovery algorithm. The results show that (1) there is a significant association between hate speech and the “care/harm” and “fairness/cheating” narratives; (2) hate speech is associated with more “harm” narratives among active users, but more “care” narratives among general users; (3) “loyalty/betrayal” narratives moderate the spread of hate speech; and (4) the number of news such as artillery attacks, attacks on humanitarian facilities, and economic sanctions predicted moral narratives and hate speech. This study reveals for the first time the relationship between different moral narratives and hate speech in the context of war, providing new findings for the field of hate speech research.</p> <h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2> <ul> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>2022.10</td> <td>Project begins</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>2023.03</td> <td>Data scrape</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>2023.06</td> <td>Chinese version completes, dissertation defense</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>2023.11</td> <td>Revise to English version, ICA24 submission</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>2024.01</td> <td>ICA24 accepted</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Now</td> <td>Revise, searching target jornal</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> </ul> </body></html>
